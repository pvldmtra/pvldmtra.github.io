                    <h2>Social Network Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The first things that may come to mind when considering the numerous roles that nonprofits play in a community are: what communities are being serviced; how effective are the nonprofits at implementing their mission statements; or what sorts of resources are available, both to the nonprofits and to their constituents?  However, an often overlooked component of the nonprofit apparatus is the ways in which nonprofits interact, network, or otherwise associate with one another.  Considering this question can tell us about the diversity, health, and reach of a community’s nonprofit system, all important but perhaps difficult characteristics to gauge from more traditional metrics.  Fortuitously, social network analysis allows us to get at some of these issues, albeit requiring a bit of massaging to discern signal from noise in the data.
</p>
                    <p>We therefore combed through pages of Lawrence Journal-World articles, in addition to annual reports, press releases, and Facebook pages to compile a list of what we consider to be accurate connections between organizations.  To clarify the methodology a bit, two or more organizations had to be involved in the same event or acknowledge one another financially or socially to be considered connected.

<p>Compiling our data in SylvaDB and exporting it into a file readable by the mapping program Gephi, we quickly came to discern two distinct patterns in our data.  First and most striking is that there are two distinct clusters of nonprofits: those that are organized around the United Way and those that orbit the Lawrence Arts Center.  This is a notable segmentation of data that would not have been noticeable otherwise due to the centrality of the United Way with almost all of the organizations we studied.  The algorithms run by Gephi focus on clustering and the number of similar connections organizations share, meaning that the number of second level connections (i.e. connections of connections shared by organizations) becomes the defining factor for our ‘invisible’ networks.  While the quantitative data provided by Gephi is incredibly helpful, qualitative analysis is equally important to bringing meaning to the data.  In particular, what this data shows is that the organizations clustering around the United Way focus more on what would be termed essential services (e.g. housing, food, health services, etc.) while those that are centered by the Lawrence Arts Center are more focused on the environment and artistic pursuits (which would make sense on one level).</p>

<p>The second rendering of our data is more difficult to determine, but there are some conclusions to be drawn from it.  First, the United Way remains at the center of the universe with three significant clusters organized around it.  The first of the clusters (in purple) are those focused on arts and environmental issues, such as the Lawrence Arts Center and the Humane Society.  The second group (in cyan) appears to be those focused on family and shelter issues, like the Lawrence Community Shelter and the LDC Housing Authority.  The third group (in red) are focused on health issues and include Headquarters, the LDC Health Dept., and Visiting Nurses.  Curiously the Lawrence Public Library is included, but we believe that to be because of the partnership with various health groups.  Finally, the last cluster is centered on the United Way and includes mostly miscellaneous organizations, but education and religion seem to be the strongest service offered among this cluster.</p>
<p>Both visualizations provide different insights into the social networks of Lawrence’s nonprofits.  Rather than an amorphous collection of organizations that each seem to differ from one another, clear patterns emerge when diving into the data, including which organizations are totemic for the community (The LAC and the United Way).  This is not to suggest that other organizations are not pillars for the communities they serve; rather, our research shows that these two organizations are best able to cross categorical bounds and connect Lawrence’s nonprofits to one another.</p>
